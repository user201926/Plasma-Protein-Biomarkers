# Plasma-Protein-Biomarkers
This study integrates three analytical phases to: (i) identify causal plasma proteins driving gastritis-to-gastric cancer progression; (ii) elucidate their molecular mechanisms; and (iii) evaluate their clinical utility for early detection and prognosis. We first performed bidirectional TSMR to identify plasma proteins with causal roles in the gastritis-to-cancer transition at the genetic level, using summary statistics from GWAS of gastritis subtypes, including alcoholic, chronic , atrophic , other types of gastritis, plasma protein quantitative trait loci , and gastric cancer traits. To establish biological relevance, we conducted scRNA-seq across gastric disease states, assessing whether genes encoding causal proteins exhibited monotonic expression progression concordant with MR effects. Cellular origins of these genes were mapped to resolve tissue-specific roles in disease transition. Then, we conducted multi-scale analyses, including cell-cell communication inference, regulatory network reconstruction, and functional enrichment to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying their cancer promoting functions. Complementary bulk transcriptomics and plasma proteomics validated the identified proteinsâ€™stage-dependent expression patterns and malignant transformation potential. Using machine learning and independent validation cohorts, we developed a diagnostic classifier for early detection and prognostic risk prediction, demonstrating the utility of these proteins in tracking disease progression
